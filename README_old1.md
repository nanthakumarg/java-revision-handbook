# Java Revision Handbook

## Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive Java revision handbook using markdown files. Each topic should be covered in-depth yet concisely, with practical applications and interview preparation materials.

Purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive Java revision handbook. This handbook will include java topics with important concepts, code examples and scenario based questions.    

Also each topic should cover differnt versions of java and it should answer to user questions like, how to use? when to use? in which scenario to use? real world examples, facts etc.

Each topic also should have common interview questions and answers.

## Content Structure Guidelines

### For Each Java Topic, Include:

1. **Core Concept Explanation**
   - Clear, concise definition
   - Key characteristics and properties
   - Syntax and basic usage
   - Important rules and constraints

2. **Real-World Applications**
   - Practical scenarios where this concept is used
   - Industry examples and use cases
   - Benefits and advantages in real projects
   - Common patterns and best practices

3. **When to Use This Concept**
   - Specific situations that require this feature
   - Problem-solving scenarios
   - Performance considerations
   - Alternative approaches and trade-offs

4. **Interview Preparation**
   - **Common Interview Questions**: 5-8 frequently asked questions with detailed answers
   - **Coding Problems**: 3-5 programming questions with complete solutions
   - **Conceptual Questions**: Theory-based questions that test understanding

## Writing Style Guidelines

- **Concise yet Comprehensive**: Explain concepts thoroughly but avoid unnecessary verbosity
- **Beginner to Advanced**: Start with basics, progress to advanced concepts
- **Code Examples**: Include practical, compilable Java code snippets
- **Output Examples**: Include expected output as inline comments in code blocks to help users understand method behavior and results
- **Visual Structure**: Use proper markdown formatting with headers, code blocks, and lists
- **Professional Tone**: Write for both students and working professionals

## Best Practices
- Key recommendations for using the concept effectively
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: All code examples must be syntactically correct and follow Java best practices
- **Completeness**: Cover both theoretical concepts and practical applications
- **Clarity**: Use simple language while maintaining technical accuracy
- **Relevance**: Focus on concepts commonly used in modern Java development and interviews
- **Examples**: Provide realistic, industry-relevant code examples


## Code Examples
```java
// Practical, well-commented examples with expected output
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println("Array length: " + numbers.length);
        // Output: Array length: 5
        
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    }
}
```

## Project Structure

```

```

- docs folder will contain the markdown files for the handbook. Organized by topics.
- Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.
- Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.
- Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
