## Usage Instructions for LLMs

When requesting content for a specific topic, use this format:

```
Please create a comprehensive markdown file for the Java topic: [TOPIC NAME]

Follow the Java Revision Handbook guidelines provided in the README.md context. 

Ensure the content includes:
- In-depth explanation with practical examples
- Real-world applications and use cases
- Interview questions with detailed answers
- Coding problems with complete solutions
- Best practices and common pitfalls

The target audience includes both students preparing for interviews and professionals seeking to refresh their Java knowledge.
```

## Quality Standards

- **Accuracy**: All code examples must be syntactically correct and follow Java best practices
- **Completeness**: Cover both theoretical concepts and practical applications
- **Clarity**: Use simple language while maintaining technical accuracy
